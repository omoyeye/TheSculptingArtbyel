What the Admin Would Control
Based on your existing AdminDashboard.tsx, the admin would have control over:

Current Admin Features
Bookings Management: View, edit, cancel, and update booking statuses
Treatments Management: Add, edit, delete, and modify treatment details (title, price, duration, description)
Products Management: Add, edit, delete, and manage product catalog
Orders Management: View and update order statuses, track shipments
Website Settings: Update contact info, business hours, social media links
Content Management: Modify website text, descriptions, and basic content
Additional Admin Controls (Not Currently Implemented)
Booking System Toggle: Enable/disable the entire booking system
Individual Treatment Availability: Toggle specific treatments on/off
Business Hours Management: Set available booking times and dates
Pricing Controls: Dynamic pricing updates
User Management: If you add user accounts later
Analytics Dashboard: Revenue, popular treatments, customer insights
Email/SMS Notifications: Control automated messaging
Gallery Management: Upload/remove before/after photos
How Booking Toggle Would Work
1. Database/Storage Level
You'd add a settings object to your server/storage.ts file:

const settings = {
  bookingEnabled: true,
  maintenanceMode: false,
  // other global settings
}
2. Admin Interface
In the AdminDashboard settings tab, add a toggle switch:

// Toggle component for enabling/disabling bookings
<Switch 
  checked={bookingEnabled} 
  onCheckedChange={setBookingEnabled}
/>
3. Frontend Implementation
The booking functionality would check this setting:

Booking Page: Show "Bookings temporarily unavailable" message when disabled
Treatment Cards: Hide "Book Now" buttons when booking is disabled
Booking Components: Display maintenance notice instead of calendar/time slots
4. API Endpoint Protection
Your booking-related API routes would check the setting:

if (!settings.bookingEnabled) {
  return res.status(503).json({ error: "Booking system temporarily disabled" });
}
5. Real-time Updates
Using your existing store system, the toggle would immediately affect:

All booking-related UI components
API availability
User experience across the site
Implementation Flow
Admin toggles booking off → Setting saved to storage
Frontend components check setting → Hide booking UI elements
API routes validate setting → Reject booking requests
Users see maintenance message → Clear communication about unavailability
Admin toggles back on → Everything returns to normal
This would give you granular control over when bookings are available, useful for maintenance, holidays, or when you're fully booked.
